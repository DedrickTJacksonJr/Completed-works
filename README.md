# Completed-works
Here are all the completed works that I have done in college
Assignment6 works on while loops and takes in two inputs to output how many 'r0''s are left when you devide r0 by r1. It is a little buggy. 

Consoleapplication2 works to encrypt the name of the file by using ROT13. 

Raviassignment2 works with file streams to make the random numbers in the input file into polynomials.
